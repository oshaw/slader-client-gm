# Slader Client
Browse textbook answers on Slader.com in faster, cleaner interface.

Displays slader.com textbook solutions as a long scrolling RESTful client. Instead of having to refresh the site to browse solutions on the next textbook page, users can browse all solutions for a section all at once. A GreaseMonkey script with an WebExtensions port.
## Installation
1. Install GreaseMonkey or Tampermonkey depending on your browser. Click [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/p/tampermonkey/9nblggh5162s?rtc=1) for Microsoft Edge.
2. Install the [script on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26910-slader-client).
3. If you get a page asking whether to allow cross-domain resource, click "Always allow". This page pops up because we're getting information from another website.
## Usage
Load up slader.com (not **www**.slader.com, which unfortunately does not work) and browse away!
